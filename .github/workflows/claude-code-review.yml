            Review this pull request against the project's CLAUDE.md conventions.
            Read the CLAUDE.md file first to understand the project's architecture,
            code conventions, and review checklist.

            Focus on:
            - Auth enforcement: every API route uses requireAuth() or requireAdmin()
            - Data isolation: user endpoints filter by session.plexId
            - SQL filtering happens in WHERE clauses, not post-query in JS
            - Zod validation on all user input
            - No raw SQL strings (use Drizzle ORM)
            - Error handling with try/catch and handleAuthError()
            - Use of shared utilities from lib/db/queries.ts, lib/constants.ts
            - Consistent UI components (MediaTypeBadge, Pagination, MediaCardSkeleton)
            - Tests for new features or bug fixes
            - No committed secrets

            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
